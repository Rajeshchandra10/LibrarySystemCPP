# LibrarySystemCPP

A C++ Library Management System using OOPS,STL and File handling 

# Library Management System (C++)

This is a console-based Library Management System built using C++.

The system allows users to add, search, display, and clear book records, with persistent storage using a text file.

It demonstrates core programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and use of STL containers like vectors.

## Features

- Add a new book (ID, title, author)
- Search books by title or author (supports partial match)
- Display all stored books
- Clear all book records (empties books.txt)
- File-based persistent storage
- Menu-driven console interface
- Structured using classes and headers

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming
- STL: `vector`, `string`
- File handling with `fstream`,`ifstream`,`ofstream`
- Tools: VS Code
